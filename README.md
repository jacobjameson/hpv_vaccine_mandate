# Human Papillomavirus Vaccine School-Entry Requirements and Vaccine Initiation in Virginia, DC, and Rhode Island, 2007-2018

Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted infection (STI) in the United States and a known cause of cancer [CDC HPV; NIH, Medline, HPV 2019]. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that more than 90% of sexually active males and over 80% of sexually active females will become infected with HPV at some point in their lives [NIH, HPV and Cancer] HPV causes most cases of cervical cancer [Chesson et al 2014], and symptoms can develop years after a sexual encounter resulting in infection [CDC HPV 2019]. Approximately 12,000 women in the U.S. will be diagnosed with cervical cancer each year, and despite screening and treatment, over 4,000 of those women will die from cervical cancer [CDC HPV] 
 
The HPV vaccine was developed as a preventive measure against HPVâ€™s transmission, and it was approved for use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2006 [CDC 2010]. The HPV vaccine is most effective in adolescent females and males, 11-18 years of age when administered prior to becoming sexually active. As of 2017, 53% of adolescent girls and 44% of adolescent boys had received all doses of the HPV vaccine; these rates are lower than for other similar vaccines, such as the tdap (tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis) or meningococcal vaccines, likely in part because of the exceptionally low rate of implementing state-level requirements for the HPV vaccine [Schwartz et al 2015].  
 
Since its FDA approval in 2006, the Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine has been politically charged, given its association with sexual health among young men and women. There was a large rush immediately following FDA approval from 2006-2007 to legislate vaccine requirements that was controversial, and largely unsuccessful [SOURCE]. Since 2006, at least 25 states have enacted legislation requiring, funding, or providing education for the HPV vaccine, yet only District of Columbia (DC), Virginia (VA), and Rhode Island (RI), require HPV vaccination for school attendance [NCSL 2018].   
 
In this study we perform a claims-based analysis of HPV vaccine initiation in the two states most different in their approach to HPV vaccine school-entry mandates.
